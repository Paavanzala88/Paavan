          <h1>What is Coding?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>Coding is how humans are able to talk with computers. Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language. Programming languages, like JavaSctipt, Java, C/C++, or Python, act as the translator between humans and machines.</p>
